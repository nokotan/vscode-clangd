# clangd

[clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org) helps developers write, understand and
improve C/C++ code by providing:

 - code completion
 - compile errors and warnings
 - go-to-definition and cross references
 - hover information and inlay hints
 - include management
 - code formatting
 - simple refactorings

This extension includes the clangd language server (built as WebAssembly,
running inside VSCode). It is not an official clangd release and this extension
is not published by the clangd developers.

Full documentation for clangd is at [clangd.llvm.org](https://clangd.llvm.org).
